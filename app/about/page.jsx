          In 2021, observing the chasm that existed between those in government
          and those governed, the dearth of a major public-private sector platform
          for reviews and cross-fertilization of development ideas, and poised to
          contribute to an informed society, acknowledging outstanding
          contributors to its development, our team spearheaded Frontier
          Discourse.

          This initiative has spurred robust discussions on inclusive peace,
          responsible governance, societal progress and development. The unique
          lecture topics, thoughtful speaker selection, transparent awardees’
          selection process and impeccable execution have set it apart. It counts
          captains of industries, spiritual leaders, traditional rulers,
          politicians, youths, civil & non-governmental organizations,
          professional bodies, secondary school students, university
          undergraduates and honored Nigerians as guests.
